This is a version of the [Minigun Supergun](https://www.arcade-projects.com/threads/minigun-supergun-an-open-source-supergun.9408/) open-source supergun that supports HD15 ("VGA") output directly.

## Is it HD15 or VGA?
Technically, the signal being output is not compliant with VGA.

You will need a monitor that supports:
 - 15kHz or 24kHz horizontal sync input (depending on arcade board)
 - Combined sync on the horizontal sync pin

## Monitor compatibility
Tested with:
 - NEC MultiSync 3D CRT

## Version History
### v2
 - Fixed headphone jack with bad footprint
 - Connected HD15 shield to ground
 - Fixed transposed blue and green lines on HD15 connector
